## Information

## Javascript Resources

 - [Image segmentation](http://rodrigoh.com/ee570/vision.html): This technique for O(n) image segmentation is a JavaScript implementation of Xue Bai and Guillermo Sapiro's paper: A Geodesic Framework for Fast Interactive Image and Video Segmentation and Matting.
 - [Clusterfck image color clustering](http://harthur.github.io/clusterfck/): clusterfck is a JavaScript library for hierarchical clustering. [Demo](http://harthur.github.io/clusterfck/demos/colors/).
 - [Pixastic Edge Detection](http://www.pixastic.com/lib/docs/actions/edges/): Pixastic JS image processing library.
 - [JSFeat Feature Detection](http://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/#imgproc): Detect features by points. Including face detection.
 - [Simple Downsampling Euclidean OCR](http://www.heatonresearch.com/fun/ocr): [Code](https://github.com/encog/encog-javascript/blob/master/examples/ocr.html).

## Not JS

 - [PWNtcha: CAPTCHA OCR](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha). There is supposed to be a JS version as greasemonkey script as well, but in the github repo I saw only C. Maybe C for training and JS for exec.
 - [Handwriting Generation with Neural Networks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/handwriting.cgi)
